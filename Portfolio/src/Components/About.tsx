          (Take through grammerly) Hey, I’m Elijah — a self-taught web developer
          with a lifelong connection to tech and a passion for creating things
          from scratch. I started my programming journey in 2023 through
          Harvard’s CS50x course, and since then, I’ve been diving deep into the
          world of web development. I mostly work with React and TypeScript on
          the frontend, paired with MySQL on the backend, with PHP as the middle
          man. One of my favorite projects so far has been recreating the SWTC
          website from the ground up — a project that not only sharpened my
          skills but also highlighted the importance of cybersecurity and
          ethical design as it can be used as a phishing website. Outside of
          code, I make music and enjoy anything that involves creating — whether
          it's sound, visuals, or software. That creative drive fuels how I
          approach development: with curiosity, attention to detail, and a focus
          on user experience. Right now, I’m pursuing my education to become an
          IT-Cybersecurity Specialist, and I’m actively looking for part-time
          opportunities where I can keep building, learning, and contributing to
          real-world projects.
